## Description

<Image src={schema} alt="UFlowPilotTask Schema" />

`UFlowPilotTask` is the base class for all Tasks that can run in FlowPilot.

The schema above shows succintely how it works.

Each Tasks starts its execution by calling their `Enter()` methods. They can either succeed or fail at this stage.
Upon failing, the task ends. If succeeded, `Tick` is then called and we check the Task Result ( InProgress, Succeeded, Failed, Error ).
If the Task returns `Succeeded` the `Exit()` method is called.

Tasks can also be cancelled, and end directly.

Each class that can be implemented need to override a couple of virtual methods exposed by this task, either in Cpp or implementing the Blueprint versions when creating a `UFlowPilotTask` via blueprint.
