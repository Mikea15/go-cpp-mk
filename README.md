# Go Cpp Mk

Go-Cpp-Mk is a simple Go application that reads C++ header files from an input directory, parses them to extract info -UnrealEngine Specific- and write Markdown (or MDx) files as documentation.

Notes:

- Made specifically for FlowPilot
- Not ready for broad usage (if you fork this, you'll need to remove a lot of hardcoded things)
- Not made to be performant
- Does not build an Abstract Syntax Tree for the Cpp Language

Cheers.
